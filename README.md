# Pokemon Classifier

This is a silly little app for classifying Pokemon.

The model was trained as an assignment in the [Fast AI](http://course.fast.ai/) course and saved 
into the `pokemon_classifier.pkl` file.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lantian773030/pokemonclassification/data) used for training was compiled by [lantian773030](https://www.kaggle.com/lantian773030) on Kaggle.

The model has an error rate of about 0.07.  It has trouble recognizing the differences between similar looking Pokemon
like Alakazam/Kadabra, Krabby/Kingler, etc...
